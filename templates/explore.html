                    <h6>About Us</h6>
                    <p>Founded in 2022 in the heart of Kathmandu, Everest Provisions blends ancient traditions with
                        modern techniques to produce high-quality, nutritious foods. Our mission is to promote

                    <h6>Product Highlight: Himalayan Gundruk</h6>
                    <p>Himalayan Gundruk is made from organically grown mustard greens, radish leaves, and cauliflower
                        leaves. These are carefully selected and fermented using traditional methods passed down through
                        generations. The result is a tangy, probiotic-rich superfood that is packed with vitamins A, C,
                        and K, as well as essential minerals like calcium and iron.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">This is a wider card with supporting text below as a natural lead-in to
                        additional content. This content is a little bit longer.Gundruk is a traditional fermented leafy
                        vegetable dish from Nepal, also enjoyed in parts of India such as Sikkim and Darjeeling. It is
                        typically made from the leaves of mustard, radish, cauliflower, or other greens, which are
                        wilted, shredded, and then fermented. The fermentation process involves packing the leaves in an
                        earthenware container, adding warm water, and allowing the natural bacteria on the leaves to
                        initiate fermentation. This process results in a tangy, slightly sour flavor, akin to sauerkraut
                        or kimchi but without added saltâ€‹</p>
